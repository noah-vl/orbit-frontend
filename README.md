Shared Second Brain 🧠
A Collaborative Knowledge Layer for Teams
Making sure the right knowledge gets to the right team member at the right time.
📖 Introduction
Modern teams consume massive amounts of information—research papers, technical docs, market analysis, and Slack threads. However, this information usually ends up scattered, forgotten, or buried in irrelevant details.
Shared Second Brain is a collaborative intelligence tool—think Obsidian for Teams—designed to solve information overload. It captures content, understands it, and personalizes it for every member of your organization. It builds a living, shared memory that ensures decisions are informed by the collective accumulated knowledge of the team.
🚀 How It Works
1. Context-Aware Capture
Whether it's a URL, a PDF, or a random thought, the system captures the "Ground Truth" of the content. But it goes further: it asks why this matters to the company and who needs to see it.
2. The "Perspective Layer" (AI Processing)
We don't just summarize articles; we translate them. The underlying AI creates unique Perspective Layers for every piece of content:
For Engineering: Highlights technical dependencies, architectural implications, and code snippets.
For Product: Focuses on user value, feature feasibility, and roadmap impact.
For Leadership: Extracts strategic opportunities, risks, and business outcomes.
3. Personalized Feed
No more drowning in noise. Your feed is tailored to your role, goals, and skill level. You see the insights relevant to you first, with the ability to toggle back to the raw source material or view the content through the lens of another department.
4. Living Knowledge Graph
As content is added, the system builds a visual Knowledge Graph. It links new articles to existing team knowledge, identifying patterns and connections that might have otherwise been missed.
5. Org Chat & Collaboration
A Slack-like interface integrated directly into the knowledge base allows teams to discuss insights where they live. Features like "Push-to-Brain" allow you to turn ephemeral chat messages into permanent company knowledge with a single click.
✨ Core Philosophy
One Source, Many Views: The original article is the truth; the insights are the lens.
Collaboration First: Knowledge shouldn't be siloed in one person's bookmarks.
Deep Context: The system learns from your company's onboarding data to provide insights that actually make sense for your specific business model.
